## What is Momentum Trading ?
Momentum trading is one of the most popular and widely used trading strategies in both retail and institutional trading. It relies on the idea that stocks that have performed well in the past will continue to perform well, and those that have performed poorly will continue to perform poorly - at least for sometime.

## What is Momentum in trading ?
In trading, it is likely if an asset's price has been rising rapidly, it is expected to keep rising
(bullish momentum)

If it has been falling sharply it is expected to keep falling (bearish momentum).

Momentum traders try to ride these trends and make profits before the trent reverses.

## What drives Momentum ?
1) Momentum is influenced by several factors, including:
Investor Psychology – When traders see an asset rising, they jump in, creating a self-reinforcing cycle.

2) Institutional Buying/Selling – Hedge funds and banks often follow trends, pushing prices further.

3) News and Events – Positive earnings reports, new product launches, or industry trends can create momentum.

4) Market Liquidity – If a stock has high trading volume, momentum is stronger since more traders are involved.

## Key Metrics and Indicators used in Momentum Trading

To measure momentum,traders use technical indicators that help them decide when to enter or exit trades. Some key ones are:

a) Rate of Change (ROC)
Measures how much the price has changed over a certain period.

Formula:


ROC = ((Current Price - Price n days ago) / Price n days ago) * 100

If ROC is positive, momentum is bullish (uptrend).
If ROC is negative, momentum is bearish (downtrend).

b) Relative Strength Index (RSI)

RSI measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes

Ranges from 0 to 100:

Above 70 : Overbought 
Below 30 : Oversold


c) Moving Averages Index (RSI)

RSI measures the speed and magnitude of recent price changes.
Ranges from 0 to 100:
Above 70: Overbought (price might reverse down).
Below 30: Oversold (price might reverse up).


d) Moving Averages (Simple & Exponential)
Moving averages help smooth out price movements.
Simple Moving Average (SMA) – Average price over a specific period (e.g., 50 days).
Exponential Moving Average (EMA) – Similar to SMA but gives more weight to recent prices.

e) Volume Analysis

High volume confirms a strong trend.
Low volume may indicate a weak trend.


## Momentum Trading Strategies
There are two main approaches to momentum trading:

A. Trend-Following Momentum Strategies
Goal: Buy assets that are already going up and sell when they start reversing.
Example:
Buy when price crosses above a moving average.
Sell when price crosses below a moving average.

B. Mean-Reversion Momentum Strategies
Goal: Buy assets when they dip and sell when they recover.
This strategy assumes momentum will eventually slow down and reverse.


## Pros and Cons of Momentum Trading
Pros:
Works well in strong bull or bear markets.
Can generate high returns in a short time.
Based on quantifiable indicators (less guessing).

Cons:
Requires fast execution (often automated).
High risk if momentum reverses suddenly.
False signals can lead to losses.
