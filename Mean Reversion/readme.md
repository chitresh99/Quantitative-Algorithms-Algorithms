# Mean Reversion

**Mean Reversion** is a financial theory that suggests that asset prices and historical returns eventually revert to their long-term mean or average level. This concept is rooted in the belief that high and low prices are temporary and that prices will tend to move back to the average over time.

Key Concepts:
Historical Mean or Average:

The historical mean is calculated over a specific period, and it represents the average price level around which the asset price oscillates.
Common measures include moving averages (simple, exponential, etc.).
Deviation from the Mean:

When the price deviates significantly from its historical mean, it creates a potential trading opportunity.
Positive deviation (price above mean): Potential signal to sell (overpriced).
Negative deviation (price below mean): Potential signal to buy (underpriced).
Reversion Mechanism:

The reversion mechanism is based on the assumption that deviations from the mean are due to short-term factors, and the price will revert to the mean once these factors dissipate.
This mechanism can be driven by investor behavior, market inefficiencies, and external factors (economic, political, etc.).
Why Mean Reversion Works:
Market Overreaction:

Investors often overreact to news, earnings reports, and other events, causing temporary price spikes or drops.
Mean reversion capitalizes on these overreactions, expecting prices to stabilize over time.
Inefficiencies and Corrections:

Financial markets are not always efficient, leading to mispricings.
Mean reversion strategies aim to profit from these inefficiencies as they are corrected.
Behavioral Finance:

Behavioral biases such as herd behavior and overconfidence can lead to deviations from the mean.
When these biases correct, prices revert to their mean.
Statistical Foundations:
Time Series Analysis:

Mean reversion is often analyzed using time series data, looking for patterns that indicate a tendency to revert to the mean.
Autoregressive models (AR) and moving average models (MA) are commonly used.
Stationarity:

A stationary time series has a constant mean and variance over time, making it easier to apply mean reversion strategies.
Non-stationary time series need to be transformed (e.g., differencing) to become stationary.
Mean Reversion Indicators:

Indicators such as Bollinger Bands, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Z-scores are used to identify mean reversion signals.
Bollinger Bands: Uses standard deviation to identify overbought and oversold conditions.
RSI: Measures the speed and change of price movements, indicating potential reversals.
Practical Considerations:
Parameter Selection:

Choosing the right parameters (e.g., look-back period for moving averages) is crucial for the success of a mean reversion strategy.
Parameters need to be optimized based on historical data and tested for robustness.
Risk Management:

Mean reversion strategies should incorporate risk management techniques to protect against prolonged deviations.
Stop-loss and take-profit orders can help manage risks.
Backtesting:

Backtesting the strategy on historical data is essential to evaluate its performance.
It helps in understanding the potential returns and risks associated with the strategy.
Market Conditions:

Mean reversion strategies may perform differently in varying market conditions (bullish, bearish, or sideways markets).
Continuous monitoring and adjustment of the strategy are necessary to adapt to changing market dynamics.
